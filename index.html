  <h3 class="h3h">Sex Problems</h3>
  How can you tell a great lover? Modern astrology often claims sex is an 8th house matter. Yet traditionally, sex and 'love making' is aligned with the 5th house. Even in modem terms, sex as a 'recreational' or 'casual experience' is clearly a 5th house activity. Those who like to be nit-picking about these matters may prefer to have sex in the 5th when it's for fun and the 8th when it involves issues of manipulation.
  Health related problems can also arise due to certain stars and planets. The branch of Astrology that deals with health and medical problems is medical astrology. Medical Astrology is an ancient science that’s deals with body, diseases and drugs. It is due to the influence of Sun, Moon, planets along with the twelve Astrological Signs. Each of the astrological signs, along with the sun, moon, and planets, is associated with different parts of the human body. The underlying basis for medical astrology, is considered to be a pseudoscience.

<li id="housep">House Problems</li>
<div class="housep"><p>
  <h3 class="h3h">House Problems</h3>
  An argument in favour of astrology is that of family relationships portrayed in the astrological charts of parent and child. Comparing the birthcharts of family members can be rather illuminating. It is often found that there is a lot of correlation between the charts of members of the same family. The genetic blueprint is not only present in DNA but also in astrology.

Often the most noticeable thing between a parent and child is the placements of the sun and moon, often coinciding with that of the ascendant of the other. In this respect, charts of family members are useful in the art of rectification where a birth time is unknown or in doubt. The sun, moon or ascendant in one family member's chart very often mirror that of another, so giving a likely indication and a basis from which to start the rectification process.

Some areas of each family member's chart will often show that certain degrees are prominent amongst the family with many planetary placements or angles located there. Sometimes signs in general show a lot of activity for each member and it can be found that certain signs always have some planet posited there, while others seem to be entirely neglected.
